# PoliStock

### Project Proposal and Outline

Our project is to observe the correlation between political elections outcomes and the stock market over the past 20 years. 
We'll examine how one party's win affects 5 market sectors as well as provide our prediction of what the market will look like after the upcomping midterm elections.

### Questions
Here are the questions we are looking to answer for this project:
* What will the stock market, as a whole, look like after political elections (midterm or presidential)?
* How do the policatal elections affect different market sectors? 
  * What sectors gain and lose the most influence/focus after elections?
* Based on our predictions, what will the market look like after the 2022 midterm elections?
